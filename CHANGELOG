[COLOR="DeepSkyBlue"]1.4 unreleased[/COLOR]
[LIST]
[*] Removed dependency on LibMainMenu library (and the code that used it). The main menu entry for pChat/rChat has never appeared in my memory of using pChat, and my testing of addons using LibMainMenu verses LibMainMenu-2.0 seems to indicate that they have issues with the latest version of the game and potentially with each other. Since having a main menu entry is not that big of a "feature", it is best to remove this potential source of problems.

Other Changes:
[LIST]
[*] Fixed UI error "rChat.lua:1522: function expected instead of nil" reported by Teva.
[*] Provided translations for the new string "Enable sound for whispers" in supported languages. (Thank you Google Translate.)
[*] Split the Zenimax code that was copied from the game (and sometimes modified) out into its own file to make it easier to keep track of and to update when we get new game patches/releases.
[/LIST]

[COLOR="DeepSkyBlue"]1.2.1[/COLOR]
[LIST]
[*] Fixed a settings error which disabled whisper sound notifications.
[*] Fixed a nil error reported by Akopian Atrebates.
[/LIST]

[COLOR="DeepSkyBlue"]1.2[/COLOR]
[LIST]
[*] Revised choices for sound notifications for both mentions and whispers so that you have more than four sounds to choose from. (Note that some of the Zenimax sounds are so subtle that they are easily overlooked, and there are two separate "No_sound" settings though I forget what their names are.) As a note, you can put your mouse cursor on the sound slider in settings and then you can 
    use the mouse wheel to advance up or down the slider as you like.
[*] Worked on a fix for a nil error in Restore Chat that ZoLatKam reported.
[/LIST]

[COLOR="DeepSkyBlue"]1.1.1[/COLOR]
[LIST]
[*] Fixed sound notifications failure to work with mentions (reported by SneakyWitchTheif)
[*] Fixed sound choice definitions for German translation.
[*] Changed color of Mention Notification header to match the colors of the other sections under Messages Settings.
[/LIST]

[COLOR="DeepSkyBlue"]1.1[/COLOR]
[LIST]
[*] Added a way to look for a "mention" in chat and colorize it and/or play a sound. It is a preliminary version that can only look for a single piece of text (that is at least 4 characters long and does not contain any of the following characters: "%*-.+()[]^$?"). Also the string is case sensitive so "hello" will not match "Hello".
[/LIST]

[COLOR="DeepSkyBlue"]1.0.2[/COLOR]
[LIST]
[*] Fixed attributions for the pChat addon that rChat was forked from.
[/LIST]

[COLOR="DeepSkyBlue"]1.0.1[/COLOR]
[LIST]
[*] Fix misspelled function name (error at 5065).
[/LIST]

[COLOR="DeepSkyBlue"]1.0[/COLOR]
[COLOR="MediumSlateBlue"]Breaking Changes[/COLOR]
[LIST]
[*] [COLOR="DarkOrange"]Now requires the libraries LibSFUtils, LibAddonMenu, LibMediaProvider-1.0, LibMainMenu, and libChat2 (note the lower case 'l') to be installed separately.[/COLOR]
[/LIST]

[COLOR="MediumSlateBlue"]Enhancements[/COLOR]
[LIST]
[*] Reimplemented the old spanish language strings. Added missing spanish translations using Google Translate.
[*] Removed LibCustomTitles
[*] Regroup option settings to make them (hopefully) easier to find.
[*] Can filter out guild recruiting messages which include a guild link. Does not attempt to detect text-only guild recruiting.
[*] Added more detection to the "looking for group/member" and "want to sell/buy/trade" messages in order to filter out more of them.
[/LIST]

[COLOR="MediumSlateBlue"]Bug Fixes[/COLOR]
[LIST]
[*] Updated chat code and data that had been copied out of ESO into the addon to comply with the current version of ESO.
*] Removed embedded libraries. The inclusion of out-of-date libraries was causing random bugs in game that were not easily traceable back to the old libraries installed by pChat.
[/LIST]

[LIST]
[*] Split out the spam filtering to its own file.
[*] Use LibSFUtils functions to handle localization strings.
[[*] Renamed addon to avoid conflicting with pChat during development (so I can still use pChat when I play in the beginning stages).
[*] Forked rChat code from version 9.3.11.25 of pChat by DesertDwellers, Ayantir, and Puddy which has not been maintained in a while.
[/LIST]
