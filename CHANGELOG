[COLOR="DeepSkyBlue"]1.5.4 (19)[/COLOR]
[LIST]
[*] Fix incorrect AddonVersion.
[*] Revised how the colors are saved in the SaveVariables. This should change over without problems, but if your colors go back to the defaults, the conversion did not work for you and you should reset the colors through the settings.
[/LIST]

[COLOR="DeepSkyBlue"]1.5.3 (18)[/COLOR]
[LIST]
[*] Fixed "Use same color for all guilds" to work again.
[*] More work with ensuring messages are displayed in chat.
[*] Removed dependency on LibDebugLogger to keep it from consuming (hiding) many SYSTEM messages.
[*] Removed the work-around since the ZOS chat system fix was released.
[/LIST]

[COLOR="DeepSkyBlue"]1.5.2 (17)[/COLOR]
[LIST]
[*] Fixed error observed when changing guild officer colors (reported by Greevir).
[*] Fixed missing names when chat is restored after a reload (reported by SimplyArmin).
[*] The missing system messages on startup appears to be fixed by the latest version of LibChatMessage. If you are getting no system messages at all, check to make sure your tab options allows system messages on the tab; and if you are a new user of LibDebugLogger, that addon can steal system messages from chat to only be displayed in the DebugLogViewer.

[COLOR="DeepSkyBlue"]1.5.1 (16)[/COLOR]
[LIST]
[*] Fix error with setting guild color not doing anything (reported by Kazzy-Poo).
[/LIST]

[COLOR="DeepSkyBlue"]1.5 (15)[/COLOR]
[COLOR="MediumSlateBlue"]Breaking Change[/COLOR]
[LIST]
[*] [COLOR="DarkOrange"]Now requires the library LibChatMessage in addition to the libraries LibSFUtils, LibAddonMenu, LibMediaProvider-1.0, and LibMainMenu to be installed separately.[/COLOR]
[*] The library libChat2 is no longer required.
[/LIST]

[COLOR="DeepSkyBlue"]1.4.4 (14)[/COLOR]
[LIST]
[*] Set AddonVersion in manifest file.
[*] Clean up link handler code.
[*] Split out color conversion code into a utils file.
[/LIST]

[COLOR="DeepSkyBlue"]1.4.3[/COLOR]
[LIST]
[*] Added in library version checking where possible to indicate when out-dated versions of the libraries we depend on are detected. Error messages for out-dated libraries are written to LibDebugLogger (required dependency) and can be viewed with the DebugLogViewer addon (recommended addon).
[*] Rewrote the color stripping and correction for messages to fix the problem in ReformateSysMessages() and the "talk like a pirate Arr" problem reported by Akopian Atrebates. (This change also requires the newest version (22) of LibSFUtil!)
[/LIST]

[COLOR="DeepSkyBlue"]1.4.2[/COLOR]
[LIST]
[*] Fixed /rchat.msg to work properly again. I hate when I back out one change too many!
[*] Moved the spam config settings to a different place in the saved variables. Users should not notice any difference though. If you have changed any of AntiSpam settings they will still be remembered.
[/LIST]

[COLOR="DeepSkyBlue"]1.4.1[/COLOR]
[LIST]
[*] Fixed chat restore on /reloadui, etc.
[/LIST]

[COLOR="DeepSkyBlue"]1.4[/COLOR]
[LIST]
[*] Fixed nil function in ZOS_Rewrite.lua error. (Reported by Kenza)
[*] Removed dependency on LibMainMenu library (and the code that used it). The main menu entry for pChat/rChat has never appeared in my memory of using pChat, and my testing of addons using LibMainMenu verses LibMainMenu-2.0 seems to indicate that they have issues with the latest version of the game and potentially with each other. Since having a main menu entry is not that big of a "feature", it is best to remove this potential source of problems until it can be reevaluated.
[/LIST]

[COLOR="DeepSkyBlue"]1.3.1[/COLOR]
[LIST]
[*] Fix "rChat.lua:3271: function expected instead of nil" error messages. (reported by SimplyArmin)
[/LIST]

[COLOR="DeepSkyBlue"]1.3[/COLOR]
[COLOR="MediumSlateBlue"]Breaking Change[/COLOR]
[LIST]
[*] [COLOR="DarkOrange"]Now requires the library LibDebugLogger in addition to the libraries LibSFUtils, LibAddonMenu, LibMediaProvider-1.0, LibMainMenu, and libChat2 (note the lower case 'l') to be installed separately.[/COLOR]
[/LIST]
Other Changes:
[LIST]
[*] Fixed UI error "rChat.lua:1522: function expected instead of nil" reported by Teva.
[*] Provided translations for the new string "Enable sound for whispers" in supported languages. (Thank you Google Translate.)
[*] Split the Zenimax code that was copied from the game (and sometimes modified) out into its own file to make it easier to keep track of and to update when we get new game patches/releases.
[/LIST]

[COLOR="DeepSkyBlue"]1.2.1[/COLOR]
[LIST]
[*] Fixed a settings error which disabled whisper sound notifications.
[*] Fixed a nil error reported by Akopian Atrebates.
[/LIST]

[COLOR="DeepSkyBlue"]1.2[/COLOR]
[LIST]
[*] Revised choices for sound notifications for both mentions and whispers so that you have more than four sounds to choose from. (Note that some of the Zenimax sounds are so subtle that they are easily overlooked, and there are two separate "No_sound" settings though I forget what their names are.) As a note, you can put your mouse cursor on the sound slider in settings and then you can 
    use the mouse wheel to advance up or down the slider as you like.
[*] Worked on a fix for a nil error in Restore Chat that ZoLatKam reported.
[/LIST]

[COLOR="DeepSkyBlue"]1.1.1[/COLOR]
[LIST]
[*] Fixed sound notifications failure to work with mentions (reported by SneakyWitchTheif)
[*] Fixed sound choice definitions for German translation.
[*] Changed color of Mention Notification header to match the colors of the other sections under Messages Settings.
[/LIST]

[COLOR="DeepSkyBlue"]1.1[/COLOR]
[LIST]
[*] Added a way to look for a "mention" in chat and colorize it and/or play a sound. It is a preliminary version that can only look for a single piece of text (that is at least 4 characters long and does not contain any of the following characters: "%*-.+()[]^$?"). Also the string is case sensitive so "hello" will not match "Hello".
[/LIST]

[COLOR="DeepSkyBlue"]1.0.2[/COLOR]
[LIST]
[*] Fixed attributions for the pChat addon that rChat was forked from.
[/LIST]

[COLOR="DeepSkyBlue"]1.0.1[/COLOR]
[LIST]
[*] Fix misspelled function name (error at 5065).
[/LIST]

[COLOR="DeepSkyBlue"]1.0[/COLOR]
[COLOR="MediumSlateBlue"]Breaking Changes[/COLOR]
[LIST]
[*] [COLOR="DarkOrange"]Now requires the libraries LibSFUtils, LibAddonMenu, LibMediaProvider-1.0, LibMainMenu, and libChat2 (note the lower case 'l') to be installed separately.[/COLOR]
[/LIST]

[COLOR="MediumSlateBlue"]Enhancements[/COLOR]
[LIST]
[*] Reimplemented the old spanish language strings. Added missing spanish translations using Google Translate.
[*] Removed LibCustomTitles
[*] Regroup option settings to make them (hopefully) easier to find.
[*] Can filter out guild recruiting messages which include a guild link. Does not attempt to detect text-only guild recruiting.
[*] Added more detection to the "looking for group/member" and "want to sell/buy/trade" messages in order to filter out more of them.
[/LIST]

[COLOR="MediumSlateBlue"]Bug Fixes[/COLOR]
[LIST]
[*] Updated chat code and data that had been copied out of ESO into the addon to comply with the current version of ESO.
*] Removed embedded libraries. The inclusion of out-of-date libraries was causing random bugs in game that were not easily traceable back to the old libraries installed by pChat.
[/LIST]

[LIST]
[*] Split out the spam filtering to its own file.
[*] Use LibSFUtils functions to handle localization strings.
[[*] Renamed addon to avoid conflicting with pChat during development (so I can still use pChat when I play in the beginning stages).
[*] Forked rChat code from version 9.3.11.25 of pChat by DesertDwellers, Ayantir, and Puddy which has not been maintained in a while.
[/LIST]

[COLOR="DarkOrange"]For changes prior to this, you should look at the [URL="https://www.esoui.com/downloads/info93-pChat.html"]pChat[/URL] addon (version 9.3.11.25) by DesertDwellers, Ayantir, and Puddy that this was based off of.[/COLOR]
