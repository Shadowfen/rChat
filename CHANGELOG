[/LIST]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prior to this, you should look at the pChat addon (version 9.3.11.25) by DesertDwellers that this was based off of.


## v9.3.11.25 ##
================
-- Updated LibCustomTitles
-- Updated Manafest to support variable AddOnVersion

This is an maintenance update, new version 9.4 is in development and will be released soon.  Was not ready to release before Murkmire update.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## v9.3.10.24 ##
===============
-- Fixed issue Tells being stored as last chat channel for a tab.

If you have the issue, simply choose a different channel for it along with sending a message.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## v9.3.8.24 ##
===============
-- Fixed issue with AGS displaying messages of purchases.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## v9.3.7.24 ##
===============
-- Default tab in settings now shows the tab names as opposed to the tab numbers.
-- Updated libCustomTitles to the most recent version to address issues with RUEso add on.
-- Remember to disable libCustomTitles follow the instructions http://www.esoui.com/downloads/info1765-DisableCustomTitles.html

Known Issue: Default Channel for default tab is still not functioning, I released this update early to accomadate issues with RUEso addon.

Note About Default Tab:  -- If tabs are renamed it may take a reloadui to get refresh the names, but as long as the tab number is still the same there will be no issue.  That is if you have your "Guild 1" tab as the default, and rename it to "G1", as long as the tab is in the same place the function for Default Tab will not be affected.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## v9.3.6.24 ##
===============
-- Fix to 9.3.5.24, fixed default tab as it ceased to function. Programmer typo 
-- Added support for library libCustomTitles, to disable it install the AddOn http://www.esoui.com/downloads/info1765-DisableCustomTitles.html

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## v9.3.5.24 ##
===============
-- Fix suggested by SlippyCheeze to avoid infinite loads
-- Combined the old keybinds with the ones recently added, now all keybinds under heading pChat.
-- Added Chat Tab Settings to addon menu.  For coming options.
-- Added option to remember the last chat channel used in a tab.  (See Below)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


## v9.3.4.23## 
===============
-- A fix put into place for line 1407 reported as a bad argument by Itabit
-- Restructred Settings menu, using submenus instead of annoying long list.
-- Changed default window darkness to 6 instead of 1.

Notes:  I have not been able to duplicate the bad argument error reported by Itabit, however, he found a solution was to start with a fresh saved vars.  I did code a fix, however I cannot confirm it will work at this point.  Please report any problems you may get with this release.

v9.3.2.23
=========
-- Fixed typos from Chat Tab lables for new bindings

v9.3.1.23
=========
This release was planned to have more changes, however I decided to push these out sooner to everyone.

-- Russian translation updated by alexesprit
-- Keybinds for up to 12 tabs, choose them in the Control options of the game menu.  Choose keybinds for each tab, when pressed, 
     you will be in that tab.
-- Fixed default tab, it was being superseeded by Chat History, it is now setting default tab after history is loaded.
-- Changed transparency selection to chose between 0 to 11.  Option "0" is not going to be the most transparent, but the default
     ESO Background.  "1" will be the most transparent, all the way up to 11 being the darkest.  You may experience when using the
     default option of 0 that it may appear too light or too dark, quit the game to desktop and go back in and it should be correct.

Next up, working on a rewrite of the settings which impact how the saved vars is saved, it will be highly likely that the Sync Chat option
may go away, opting for a selection of either character based settings, or account wide settings.  Unless I discover another use of the chat 
sync that will impact the add on negatively.

v9.3.0.23
=======
-- Updated Chat Transparency to have 10 levels of transparency. Always wanted more choices on this :)

v9.2.23
=======
-- Updated libaddonmenu library to r26
-- Keybinding to whisper target is functioning correctly
-- Restored saving up to 24 hours of chat.
-- Restored Augment feature going from 200 lines to 1000 lines.
-- Problem of intermittent freezing at login from character screen should be resolved.

Plus, the timer for chat restoration is now based on each message timestamp and not logout time (if you set the timer to 3h, delog/relog immediatly, the messages past 3h won't be restored). Please note that for a ReloadUI, this timer is still ignored.

Because of this small change, the chat reverted from previous versions of pChat won't get their colors but default channel ones. Plus all System Messages reverted from previous versions of pChat will be stripped.

v2.4
=======
- Added History :
When you'll reloadUI Your TextEntry history (available with up/down arrow key) will re restored, your chat will be restored, your current channel will also be restored. This action is enabled per default and can be disabled.
If you active the Chat Sync feature (available in options - activated per default in last release), You could also activate this option if you LogOut get kicked on just leave game. For those 3 settings a shared timer in hours is added.
PS: If you crash (any reason), the last session won't be restored, but the precedent one, I can't do anything for it, just don't crash

- Added Switch to Next Tab feature - It will permit you to switch to the next tab. Default Keybind is Shift+Tab, if you hit Shift while stealth, you'll stand up, so you'll maybe need to rebind this action. You can change it in your UI settings keybinds

- Added Whisp Notification.
If you activate this option, when you'll receive a whisp, if your actual tab don't show IM's or you didn't scrolled at the bottom, a notification will pop at the top right corner of the Chat Window. If you click on sender name, the chat will scroll at the button or switch to the next tab with IM enabled and scroll at the bottom. If your chat was Minimized when you receive an IM, a "IM" button will appear in red in the mini chat bar. It will show you the sender name and it's IM.
Clicking on it will restore your chat and same as before. This feature is disabled per default.

Improved copy dialog, the pages 2+ didn't get focus when opening them
Fixed system messages which outputs now to all containers for users of ChatIt with this option activated.

v2.3
=======
- You can now choose in which tab System messages are displayed As the option is tab-dependant, the checkbox is in the parameters of your tab.
Take care: As a lot of addons output to chat, you're strongly prompted to keep at least SysMessages in 1 tab.
Developpers: Due to restrictions, pChat will snip your output to ChatSystem before this one will be completly ready (mainly for AddonLoaded debug).
- Fixes rares bugs with unknown books linked into the chat, convertName which was failing in some rares cases and Guild Reorganization

v2.2a

v2.1
=======

- Added Font selector

15 new fonts included for people who would like to change their font.
To add yourself a font :
First, download a font with TrueType format (.ttf) or OpenType format (.otf)
Then paste it in pChat\fonts folder. You can create a new folder or just put the file here, as you want. Please don't include .txt files
Then, open with a text editor file pChat\fonts.lua (use notepad or a better tool, like Notepad++)
At the end of file, add your font like this : pChat.fontCollection["Font Name"] = "pChat/fonts/Folder/file.ttf" - Windows users must use "/" also.
Save and close.
Do a /ReloadUI ingame
Go in pChat settings, your font will be added in the dropdown Fonts. Just select it. It will reloadUI your game.
Take Care of Minion and updates, Minion and Updates generally erase the whole content of an addon. If your font is erased the chat won't be shown and the entrybox will be really small. If you get this problem, you can still type commands (like /reloadui) or go in pChat Settings and select font "ESO Standard Font"

EU Users : If you need to use your language specific characters, Here are the characters that the game actually handles. Some fonts don't include all of them : !\"#$%&'()*+,-./0123456789:;<=>?@ ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ [\]^_`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz{|} ~¡£¤¦§©«-®°²³´µ¶·»½¿ ÀÁÂÄÆÇÈÉÊËÌÍÎÏÑÒÓÔÖ×ÙÚÛÜßàáâäæçèéêëìíîïñòóôöùúûüÿŸ

- Added anti-reorganization guild :
When you leave a guild, and the guild you just left was not the last of your list, the guilds are reorganized. Leaving Guild1 means your guild2 become 1, the 3 become2, etc
So, now, when you leave a guild, pChat just rollback your guild color settings / Chat tabs settings / Your pChat default channel

- Fixed color of entry box for users of pChat colors. Now the entry color is same as 1st pChat color. If you use ESO social colors, you don't care of this fix.


v2
=======
- Added an Anti-Spam : For now, 3 subfilters :
Flood, Enabled per default. Protects Only geo-channels (Zone, ZFR, ZDE, ZEN, Say, Yells, Emote) Same messages in defined timer (0-180 seconds, 30 per default) are dropped.
Looking For : Disabled per default, Drop LFG/LFM messages in all channels
Want To : Disabled per default, Drop WTB/WTS/WTT messages in all channels

Guild Recruitment and Gold Spam will be added in a future release.
