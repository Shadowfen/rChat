[COLOR="DeepSkyBlue"]1.13 (33)[/COLOR]
[LIST]
[*] Make PARTY messages use the same brackets/no brackets setting for names as other message types do. (Declined request to do the same for WHISPER messages because they are treated specially by ZOS.) (Requested by saenic)
[/LIST]

[COLOR="DeepSkyBlue"]1.12 (32)[/COLOR]
[LIST]

[LIST]
[*] API bump (Markarth)
[/LIST]

[COLOR="DeepSkyBlue"]1.10 (29)[/COLOR]
[LIST]
[*] Added the option to turn on mention detection for emotes. This is turned off by default because it can slow things down (as emote messages are frequently longer). Note that if the mention that is detected causes the message length to become too long, the mention (and probably the message color) will be discarded so that the message text can still be shown. (Feature requested by Keresthus)
[*] Fixed chat not fade timeout (reported by Saenic and FrostByghte)
[/LIST]

[COLOR="DeepSkyBlue"]1.9 (28)[/COLOR]
[LIST]
[*] Introduced a fix for messages that are too long to be displayed properly. If a message is too long to be displayed with all of the various rChat display options in effect, then rChat will mark the message with an initial '*' to denote that it is "reduced", and start removing the less essential options, like: color in messages, mentions in messages, guild tags (if enabled), zone tags (if enabled), fancy formatted display of from name, the "click name to whisper" link on the name, and even the right-click context menu normally attached to the timestamp. Finally if the message is still too long, it will be truncated to fit into chat - generally a reduction of characters close to the number of characters in your @name.
[*] Reduced the amount of data stored for conversations in rChatData.
[*] API bump.

[COLOR="DeepSkyBlue"]1.8 (24)[/COLOR]
This was actually supposed to be version 1.9, only when I started to package up and update the changelog I discovered that I never actually released 1.8 after getting it ready. So, new fixes and features get rolled in to 1.8 and I am going to release it this time. Promise!

[COLOR="MediumSlateBlue"]Enhancements[/COLOR]
[LIST]
[*] Added new name format option of "character(@account)" as requested by Kenza.
[*] Added the ability to specify multiple mention strings to watch for (one per line) in settings. Only one of the mentions will be highlighted/colored if there are multiples in a message. rChat does not look for mentions in NPC chatter, system messages, emotes, or whispers.
[*] Added a setting to the Windows section that allows you to enable or disable the LibDebugLogger "BlockChatOutput" which is responsible for hiding messages from addons which used to go in chat into the DebugLogger instead so that you could only see them if you installed the DebugLogViewer addon as well and look there. The setting is enabled by default in LibDebugLogger. rChat now changes this setting to disabled when it loads and gives you the option of choosing which you prefer by changing the setting in rChat settings->Windows. With this change, you can now have LibDebugLogger and still see your SYSTEM messages if you want! (Note: that you can use rChat to direct all of your SYSTEM messages to a specific tab and keep them out of the other chat tabs if you want to be able to look at them but don't want them otherwise cluttering up your chat.)
[*] Added the ability to clear out the saved chat history with a button in the settings.
[*] Saved chat history is now saved account-wide so that you can log out from one character and log in with another and see the previous chat history restored to the chat window (with the appropriate restore settings of course). This seems more useful to me, and consumes less disk space since I'm not saving extended-size chat logs for each and every character.
[*] [COLOR="MediumSeaGreen"]Breaking Change[/COLOR]The chat history is now being saved in a separate saved variables file (rChatData.lua) and you must enable the rChatData "addon" for rChat to work now. The rChatData "addon" is not actually a separate addon to download - it is included as a part of rChat and exists to separate the configuration variables from the chat saved history. You do have to enable it as a part of the addons that you run because rChat depends on it.
[*] Part 1 of revising how chat history is collected, accessed, and saved. The goal is to separate out the chat history data from the configuration data and to make the chat history management more resilient.
[/LIST]

[COLOR="MediumSlateBlue"]Fixes & Misc Changes[/COLOR]
[LIST]
[*] Fixed the /r, /reply, /respond commands to respond to the last whisperer to come in.
[*] Fixed nil errors that were being thrown by CopyMessage menu option.
[*] Changed the message parsing and formatting to eliminate the "triggered Link Handling infinite loop" message that you would sometimes see.
[*] Revised how the settings for whisper message options are saved in the SaveVariables. This should change over without problems, but you can always change the whisper options through settings.
[*] [COLOR="MediumSeaGreen"]Removed Conversion[/COLOR] Conversion code that changed the saved colors in version 1.4.3 of saved variables to the new format in version 1.4.4 has been removed. If you are wanting to upgrade from a pre-1.4.4 version of rChat, you can either upgrade to version 1.5.4 first to get your settings converted; or you can upgrade to this version and redo your settings from the defaults.
[*] [COLOR="MediumSeaGreen"]Removed Conversion[/COLOR] Conversion code that changed the saved anti-spam settings in version 1.4.1 of saved variables to the new format in version 1.4.2 has been removed. If you are wanting to upgrade from a pre-1.4.2 version of rChat, you can either upgrade to version 1.5.4 first to get your settings converted; or you can upgrade to this version and redo your settings from the defaults.
[*] Standardized on a SafeGetGuildName() which can handle the rare occasions where GetGuildName() returns an empty value.
[/LIST]

[COLOR="DeepSkyBlue"]1.5.4 (19)[/COLOR]
[LIST]
[*] Fix incorrect AddonVersion.
[*] Revised how the colors are saved in the SaveVariables. This should change over without problems, but if your colors go back to the defaults, the conversion did not work for you and you should reset the colors through the settings.
[/LIST]

[COLOR="DeepSkyBlue"]1.5.3 (18)[/COLOR]
[LIST]
[*] Fixed "Use same color for all guilds" to work again.
[*] More work with ensuring messages are displayed in chat.
[*] Removed dependency on LibDebugLogger to keep it from consuming (hiding) many SYSTEM messages.
[*] Removed the work-around since the ZOS chat system fix was released.
[/LIST]

[COLOR="DeepSkyBlue"]1.5.2 (17)[/COLOR]
[LIST]
[*] Fixed error observed when changing guild officer colors (reported by Greevir).
[*] Fixed missing names when chat is restored after a reload (reported by SimplyArmin).
[*] The missing system messages on startup appears to be fixed by the latest version of LibChatMessage. If you are getting no system messages at all, check to make sure your tab options allows system messages on the tab; and if you are a new user of LibDebugLogger, that addon can steal system messages from chat to only be displayed in the DebugLogViewer.
[/LIST]

[COLOR="DeepSkyBlue"]1.5.1 (16)[/COLOR]
[LIST]
[*] Fix error with setting guild color not doing anything (reported by Kazzy-Poo).
[/LIST]

[COLOR="DeepSkyBlue"]1.5 (15)[/COLOR]
[COLOR="MediumSlateBlue"]Breaking Change[/COLOR]
[LIST]
[*] [COLOR="DarkOrange"]Now requires the library LibChatMessage in addition to the libraries LibSFUtils, LibAddonMenu, LibMediaProvider-1.0, and LibMainMenu to be installed separately.[/COLOR]
[*] The library libChat2 is no longer required.
[/LIST]

[COLOR="DeepSkyBlue"]1.4.4 (14)[/COLOR]
[LIST]
[*] Set AddonVersion in manifest file.
[*] Clean up link handler code.
[*] Split out color conversion code into a utils file.
[/LIST]

[COLOR="DeepSkyBlue"]1.4.3[/COLOR]
[LIST]
[*] Added in library version checking where possible to indicate when out-dated versions of the libraries we depend on are detected. Error messages for out-dated libraries are written to LibDebugLogger (required dependency) and can be viewed with the DebugLogViewer addon (recommended addon).
[*] Rewrote the color stripping and correction for messages to fix the problem in ReformateSysMessages() and the "talk like a pirate Arr" problem reported by Akopian Atrebates. (This change also requires the newest version (22) of LibSFUtil!)
[/LIST]

[COLOR="DeepSkyBlue"]1.4.2[/COLOR]
[LIST]
[*] Fixed /rchat.msg to work properly again. I hate when I back out one change too many!
[*] Moved the spam config settings to a different place in the saved variables. Users should not notice any difference though. If you have changed any of AntiSpam settings they will still be remembered.
[/LIST]

[COLOR="DeepSkyBlue"]1.4.1[/COLOR]
[LIST]
[*] Fixed chat restore on /reloadui, etc.
[/LIST]

[COLOR="DeepSkyBlue"]1.4[/COLOR]
[LIST]
[*] Fixed nil function in ZOS_Rewrite.lua error. (Reported by Kenza)
[*] Removed dependency on LibMainMenu library (and the code that used it). The main menu entry for pChat/rChat has never appeared in my memory of using pChat, and my testing of addons using LibMainMenu verses LibMainMenu-2.0 seems to indicate that they have issues with the latest version of the game and potentially with each other. Since having a main menu entry is not that big of a "feature", it is best to remove this potential source of problems until it can be reevaluated.
[/LIST]

[COLOR="DeepSkyBlue"]1.3.1[/COLOR]
[LIST]
[*] Fix "rChat.lua:3271: function expected instead of nil" error messages. (reported by SimplyArmin)
[/LIST]

[/LIST]
Other Changes:
[LIST]
[*] Fixed UI error "rChat.lua:1522: function expected instead of nil" reported by Teva.
[*] Provided translations for the new string "Enable sound for whispers" in supported languages. (Thank you Google Translate.)
[*] Split the Zenimax code that was copied from the game (and sometimes modified) out into its own file to make it easier to keep track of and to update when we get new game patches/releases.
[/LIST]

[COLOR="DeepSkyBlue"]1.2.1[/COLOR]
[LIST]
[*] Fixed a settings error which disabled whisper sound notifications.
[*] Fixed a nil error reported by Akopian Atrebates.
[/LIST]

[COLOR="DeepSkyBlue"]1.2[/COLOR]
[LIST]
[*] Revised choices for sound notifications for both mentions and whispers so that you have more than four sounds to choose from. (Note that some of the Zenimax sounds are so subtle that they are easily overlooked, and there are two separate "No_sound" settings though I forget what their names are.) As a note, you can put your mouse cursor on the sound slider in settings and then you can 
    use the mouse wheel to advance up or down the slider as you like.
[*] Worked on a fix for a nil error in Restore Chat that ZoLatKam reported.
[/LIST]

[COLOR="DeepSkyBlue"]1.1.1[/COLOR]
[LIST]
[*] Fixed sound notifications failure to work with mentions (reported by SneakyWitchTheif)
[*] Fixed sound choice definitions for German translation.
[*] Changed color of Mention Notification header to match the colors of the other sections under Messages Settings.
[/LIST]

[COLOR="DeepSkyBlue"]1.1[/COLOR]
[LIST]
[*] Added a way to look for a "mention" in chat and colorize it and/or play a sound. It is a preliminary version that can only look for a single piece of text (that is at least 4 characters long and does not contain any of the following characters: "%*-.+()[]^$?"). Also the string is case sensitive so "hello" will not match "Hello".
[/LIST]

[COLOR="DeepSkyBlue"]1.0.2[/COLOR]
[LIST]
[*] Fixed attributions for the pChat addon that rChat was forked from.
[/LIST]

[COLOR="DeepSkyBlue"]1.0.1[/COLOR]

[/LIST]

[COLOR="MediumSlateBlue"]Enhancements[/COLOR]
[LIST]
[*] Reimplemented the old spanish language strings. Added missing spanish translations using Google Translate.
[*] Removed LibCustomTitles
[*] Regroup option settings to make them (hopefully) easier to find.
[*] Can filter out guild recruiting messages which include a guild link. Does not attempt to detect text-only guild recruiting.
[*] Added more detection to the "looking for group/member" and "want to sell/buy/trade" messages in order to filter out more of them.
[/LIST]

[COLOR="MediumSlateBlue"]Bug Fixes[/COLOR]
[LIST]
[*] Updated chat code and data that had been copied out of ESO into the addon to comply with the current version of ESO.
*] Removed embedded libraries. The inclusion of out-of-date libraries was causing random bugs in game that were not easily traceable back to the old libraries installed by pChat.
[/LIST]

[LIST]
[*] Split out the spam filtering to its own file.
[*] Use LibSFUtils functions to handle localization strings.
[[*] Renamed addon to avoid conflicting with pChat during development (so I can still use pChat when I play in the beginning stages).
[*] Forked rChat code from version 9.3.11.25 of pChat by DesertDwellers, Ayantir, and Puddy which has not been maintained in a while.
[/LIST]

[COLOR="DarkOrange"]For changes prior to this, you should look at the [URL="https://www.esoui.com/downloads/info93-pChat.html"]pChat[/URL] addon (version 9.3.11.25) by DesertDwellers, Ayantir, and Puddy that this was based off of.[/COLOR]
